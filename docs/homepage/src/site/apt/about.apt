About OpenCIT

  The Open Continuous Integration and Test (OpenCIT) server can be used to automatically build,
  test and deploy projects. It makes it easier for developers to integrate changes and easier for
  users to obtain fresh builds of a project. 
  
  The OpenCIT tries to provide additional benefits
  compared to other CI & T solutions by building upon the open and highly customizable 
  {{{http://www.openengsb.org}OpenEngSB}} platform. Furthermore the OpenCIT itself is also a FOSS
  project, which provides its users with the possibility to adapt all aspects of the CI & T process.
  
  The domain and connector concept of the OpenEngSB make it possible to define the OpenCIT workflow
  completely independent of specific tools. Therefore any build, test and deploy tool can be used together
  with the OpenCIT.
