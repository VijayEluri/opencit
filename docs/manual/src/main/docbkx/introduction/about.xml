  <title>What is the Open Continuous Integration And Test Server</title>

  <para>
    The Open Continuous Integration and Test (OpenCIT) server can be used to automatically build, test and 
    deploy projects. It makes it easier for developers to integrate changes and easier for users to obtain 
    fresh builds of a project.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    The OpenCIT tries to provide additional benefits compared to other CI &amp; T solutions by building upon the 
    open and highly customizable <link xlink:href="http://www.openengsb.org">OpenEngSB platform</link>. 
    Furthermore the OpenCIT itself is also a FOSS project, which provides its users with the possibility to 
    adapt all aspects of the CI &amp; T process.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    The domain and connector concept of the OpenEngSB make it possible to define the OpenCIT workflow completely 
    independent of specific tools. Therefore any build, test and deploy tool can be used together with the OpenCIT.
