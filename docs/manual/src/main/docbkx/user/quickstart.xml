    <section>
        <title>Setting up the OpenCIT</title>
        <para>
            To set up a basic OpenCIT setup follow these steps:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    Create a new unpriviledged user on your host. This is not strictly needed, but highly recommended for
                    security purposes
                </listitem>
                <listitem> Unpack the OpenCIT archive in a folder of your choice</listitem>
                <listitem>
                    Execute
                    <programlisting>
                        opencit/bin/karaf.sh server
                    </programlisting>
                    to run the server. To be able to log off from the shell without terminating the server you can user
                    <programlisting>
                        screen opencit/bin/karaf.sh
                    </programlisting>
                    There is also a start script for Microsoft Windows systems in opencit/bin/karaf.bat
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    OpenCIT is now running and listening to port 8095. To configure it and set up projects use any webbrowser
                    to navigate to http://localhost:8095
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Using the OpenCIT</title>
        <para>
            Once OpenCIT is running use a webbrowser to open http://localhost:8095. Log in at the login screen with the
            (currently hardcoded) username "user" and password "password". After a successful login you will see a list
            of configured projects, which is empty in a freshly installed OpenCIT.
        </para>
        <section>
            <title>Setting up a project</title>
            <para>
                To set up a new project you have to configure 6 connectors:
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        SCM Domain: The SCM domain connector is responsible for downloading the source code and
                        notifying OpenCIT when new commits arrive.
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem> Build Domain: This connector is responsible for compiling the source code. </listitem>
                    <listitem> Test Domain: This connector executes your unit and/or integration tests. </listitem>
                    <listitem> Deploy Domain: ??? </listitem>
                    <listitem> Notification Domain: This connector sends out notifications(e.g. Emails) with the
                        results of test runs.
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem> Report Domain: This connector archives the results of past test runs.</listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
